Project issues:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Cannot access second degree profile connections like:
  "v1/people/id=<2nd-deg-id>/connections"
  "v1/people/id=<2nd-deg-id>:(connections)"
  -> You cannot "browse connections." That is, you can only get the connections of the user who granted your application access. You cannot get connections of that user's connections.

- The number of total search results for people is limited and depends on the account type
